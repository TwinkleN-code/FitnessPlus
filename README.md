# Fitness Plus project

In this project, a simple system to store and manage the information of members of Fitness Plus (Fit+), a health and fitness club where various services are offered to help its members meet their fitness goals is made. A membership management system is needed at the customer service to register new members.
The application can add new members, trainers and admins. Various options such as update, delete, modify and search profiles are implemented. Events are logged. Backup of the system can be made and restored. 
This assignment consists of the design and implementation of a simple console-based interface in Python 3 and a local SQLite 3 database to store personal informations of members and users.

The learning goals:
1.	To understand the common mistakes of coders in input validation and communications with subsystems.
2.	To apply the knowledge of input validation, SQL injection, and cryptography.
3.	To partially build a secure system against various attacks initiated by user input.

To run the code, 2 libraries needs to be installed with following command: 
1) ```pip install bcryp```
2) ```pip install cryptography```

The source file to execute is ```fitplus.py```
